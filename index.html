        <h2>Understanding Rainfall Trends</h2>
        <p>
          Across Australia, average rainfall has declined from around 3.3 mm to
          2.5 mm between 2007 and 2017. <br />This shift may seem small, but it
          reflects broader changes in regional weather systems and the
          hydrological cycle.<br />
          Rainfall is one of the most visible indicators of Australia’s climate
          balance and while it is not the only factor influencing bushfires,
          declining precipitation contributes to drier vegetation and soil,
          which together create the conditions for larger and more frequent
          fires. <br />Tracking rainfall over time helps us identify how
          Australia’s changing climate is reshaping both ecosystems and fire
          risk.

        <h2>Changing Temperatures in Australia</h2>
        <p>
          Since the 1960s, Australia’s surface temperatures have climbed
          steadily, with recent decades showing the sharpest rise on record.<br />
          This long-term warming trend is consistent with global patterns driven
          by greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere.<br />
          The impacts are visible everywhere, from record-breaking heatwaves to
          altered rainfall timing and reduced water availability.<br />
          As climate change continues, the question is no longer whether human
          activity contributes, but how effectively we can adapt and reduce our
          collective impact.<br />
          Australia’s response today will shape its environmental resilience for
          generations to come.

        <h2>Growing Fires in Australia</h2>
        <p>
          Between 1990 and 2020, the total land area burned by bushfires has
          nearly doubled.<br />
          While fire is an essential and natural part of many Australian
          ecosystems, the frequency and intensity of recent fire seasons suggest
          that climate conditions are amplifying their scale.<br />
          Hotter, drier years combined with prolonged drought and reduced
          rainfall are transforming once-cyclical fire events into
          climate-driven crises.<br />
          This raises an important question: are we witnessing a new normal in
          the Australian fire landscape, or the consequence of decades of
          unsustainable emission trends and land-use pressure?

        <h2>Australia in the Global Climate Balance</h2>
        <p>
          The map of recent fire intensities reveals a troubling pattern, large
          portions of rural and agricultural Australia are repeatedly affected
          by severe bushfires.<br />
          These areas form the economic and ecological backbone of the nation,
          and while urban centres may remain relatively insulated, the damage to
          regional livelihoods, biodiversity, and air quality is profound.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we broaden our view globally, the story becomes even more
          complex. Despite having a smaller population, Australia ranks among
          the world’s highest CO₂ emitters per capita, placing it alongside
          major industrial nations such as the United States and China. <br />
          Raw emissions figures can obscure this imbalance, once normalised per
          person, Australia’s footprint highlights the challenges of a
          resource-intensive economy and its reliance on carbon-heavy energy
          production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among domestic contributors, the electricity, gas, steam, and
          air-conditioning sector stands out, producing more emissions than the
          next nine industries combined. This dominance reflects the country’s
          continued dependence on fossil fuels for power generation.<br />
          Transitioning toward cleaner, renewable energy sources represents both
          a significant challenge and an enormous opportunity, one that will
          determine whether Australia can continue to thrive economically while
          playing its part in stabilising the global climate system.
